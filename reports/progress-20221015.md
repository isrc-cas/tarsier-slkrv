Problems with `llvmpipe` has been encountered during test.
It should be caused by `mesa` (version 21 and 22) `gallium` driver
calling `llvm` JIT (from version 13 through 15)
not supporting RISC-V target yet.
to work around this problem for now,
use `removepkg` to uninstall `llvm` so that the `llvmpipe` breaks
and would not be used.
Patches to fix this problem in a better approach is under development.
