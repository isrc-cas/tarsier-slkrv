# Progress Brief Report 20221111
## Complete Build of `tcl` Subset Packages 

The `tcl` subset packages of upstream Slackware repo
are completed and availabe at

https://repo.tarsier-infra.com/Slackware-RISC-V/slackware-riscv64/15.0.20221110-1111/tcl/

Built packages are now being sorted into directories
using the hierarchy of upstream Slackware repo,
like `a`, `ap`, `d`, `k`, `l`, `n`, `tcl`, etc.

Built packages from `x11` subdirectory of `x` in source 
are separated into `x11` instead of `x`.

The kernel firmware is sorted into `k` rather than `a`.

Packages still with some problems will go to `alternative`.
Packages not in `alternative` will have a duplicate in `everything`.
