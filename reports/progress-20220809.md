# Cross build LLVM 13.0.1

Succeeded to build LLVM 13.0.1 with GCC 11.2
with `CFLAGS= -O2 -fPIC -latomic`.

The built Clang is functional but cannot be used in
script to build LLVM itself because during configure
checking for C compiler usability, `ld.bfd` is used
instead of `ld.lld` and `ld.bfd` lacks some libraries
to work together with `clang`.

The `gold` linker is not built for riscv64.
Attempt to configure the build script using `ld.lld`
rather than `ld.bfd` failed and still wait for another
solution.
