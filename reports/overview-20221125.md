# A brief review of HollaLinux project in 2022 among other riscv64 ports of Slackware
File: reports/overview-20221125.md

It has been 4 months since the first stable release of HollaLinux's
bootable riscv64 port of Slackware containing a bootstraped toolchain. 
Lots of progresses has been made in HollaLinux and exciting achivements
also happened in other efforts porting Slackware to riscv64.

Though an early

[port by Alvaro Figueroa](https://github.com/fede2cr/slackware_riscv)
has been inactive for almost a year and never got a bootable image,
2 major ports appeared in

[BonSlack](https://bonslack.org/)
by *Luca Bonissi* (as the bonslack.org website says 
Powered by Apache 2.4.54 on Slackware64-15.0 - Maintained by Luca Bonissi),
which is also announced by *sndwvs* on **LinuxQuestions**,
while neither of them provided a bootable image when __HollaLinux__ was started.

Both __slarm64__ and __BonSlack__ are now more complete than __HollaLinux__
in number of successfully built upstream Slackware packages on riscv64.
However these two projects annonced by the same author do not seem to
collabrate together and make their own progress in a very slack way.

The advantage of HollaLinux's riscv64 port of Slackware remains in
providing more desktop and third party applications than other ports,
and it is still the only port that has a working Mozilla Firefox so far.

A rebase of the HollaLinux project shall be seriously considered,
but HollaLinux selected a different source base that is incompatible
with the mentioned 2 ports.
A more feasible solution might be making a collaborative effort to
port packages not available on those major bases to minimize the workload.

It is nevertheless a good sign to see RISC-V attracts more communities
and HollaLinux as a TARSIER subproject can still play a role in the
open-source world to interface open software with open hardware.
