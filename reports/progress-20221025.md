## Build LLVM 13 with Clang 13 and ld.mold

LLVM 13 is now successfully built with Clang 13
and mold 1.5.1 instead of the GOLD or BFD linker.

From now on `mold` will be included in the main repo.
SlackBuild script is imported from SlackBuilds.org 
and modified for faster build using parallel make jobs.
