# Proposal 20221120
## Run on Allwinner D1 SoC board

OpenSBI 1.1 was released on 2022 Jun 25
and supports Allwinner D1 platform.

The u-boot fork for D1 from *smaeul* also
got great progress in supporting SPL
since 2022 Nov 1 and simplifies the
work for booting Linux on D1.

It is now time to bring this project on real hardware!
