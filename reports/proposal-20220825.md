# Proposal 20220825
## Add Features of Web Browser and Media Player

Since Xfce4 desktop GUI is working, the next stage
is to have a useable web browser and media player
for a better user experience as a daily use desktop.
Candidates are Mozilla Firefox and VLC,
others may also be considered.

Office suite software like LibreOffice is under
our observation for port works on riscv64.
